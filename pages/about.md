## Background

I am a scientist with a Ph.D. in computational biology and I've spent a lot of my life studying protein folding - basically looking at aspects of life that are no bigger than a nanometer (see [my latest publications](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=zackary+scholl)). 



The name of this site, **Big Animal Paintings**, comes from my tendency to paint large paintings of large animals (bison, large primates, cows, bears). I started painting large animals as a way to observe life on a scale that is no longer microscopic. Animals are a million times bigger than the usual objects of my observation, but that makes them no less fascinating and intriguing. Painting provides a totally new lens to look at the world around me, it allows me to truly see the colors and the shapes on a way Iâ€™ve never appreciated at a scale I've often neglected to observe.


I like my paintings to deliver the sense of scale and magnificence of these creatures, so I often try to make close-to one-to-one representations. I also enjoy revealing the process of painting itself through my paintings, which is why many of the brush strokes are more obvious. Brush strokes also give a sense of motion to the painting, which is fitting since many of our interactions with these animals is fleeting.

A lot of my inspiration comes from my time living in Canada and visiting the [Elk Island National Park](https://www.pc.gc.ca/en/pn-np/ab/elkisland) near every week for a year. I ran hundreds of miles around the park, and often encountered bison. I tried not to disturb them and only tried to observe them as they observed me. These are the largest creatures I've ever seen up close, and they are astounding. They are able to survive the frozen Canadian winter and they can grow to thousands of pounds by only eating vegetation!
