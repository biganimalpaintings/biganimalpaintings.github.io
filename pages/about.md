## Background

I’m a scientist, trained to look at life from a microscopic perspective. Through painting I’ve taken to observing life from a more macroscopic perspective. Painting provides a totally new lens to look at the world around me, it allows me to truly see the colors and the shapes on a way I’ve never appreciated.

I tend to paint large paintings of large animals, in order to give the sense of scale and magnificence of these creatures. I also enjoy revealing the process of painting itself through my paintings, which is why many of the brush strokes are more obvious, giving the impression of a true transformation of the animal into a painting.
